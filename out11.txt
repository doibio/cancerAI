	message: What cancers have been treated with ImmTAC?
	text: ImmTAC (immune-mobilising monoclonal TCRs against cancer) is a new class of bispecific reagents that have been engineered to possess high affinity for cognate tumour antigens. It specifically recognises human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted tumour-associated antigens, presented by cancer cells. 

Once bound to tumour cells, an anti-CD3 effector end of the ImmTAC drives recruitment of polyclonal T cells to the tumour site, leading to a potent redirected T cell response and tumour cell destruction. 

I did not find any information on the cancers that have been treated with ImmTAC so far. 

Would you like to know more about this therapy?

It follows, therefore, that the capacity of emerging immunotherapeutic \nagents to orchestrate tumour eradication may depend on their ability to induce \nantigen cross-presentation. ImmTACs [immune-mobilising monoclonal TCRs (T cell \nreceptors) against cancer] are a new class of soluble bi-specific anti-cancer \nagents that combine pico-molar affinity TCR-based antigen recognition with T \ncell activation via a CD3-specific antibody fragment.', 'title': '24531387'}, {'id': 'doc_7:1', 'snippet': " ImmTACs specifically \nrecognise human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted tumour-associated antigens, \npresented by cancer cells, leading to T cell redirection and a potent \nanti-tumour response.

These, in turn, can activate both melanoma-specific T cells and \npolyclonal T cells redirected by IMCgp100. Moreover, activation of \nmelanoma-specific T cells by cross-presenting DCs is enhanced in the presence of \nIMCgp100; a feature that serves to increase the prospect of breaking tolerance \nin the tumour microenvironment. The mechanism of DC cross-presentation occurs \nvia 'cross-dressing' which involves the rapid and direct capture by DCs of \nmembrane fragments from dying tumour cells.", 'title': '24531387'}]
