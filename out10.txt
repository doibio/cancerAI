	message: Write a review article for ImmTAC with references.
	text: ImmTAC (immune-mobilising monoclonal TCRs against cancer) is a novel class of T cell-redirecting bispecific biologics. They are engineered to possess high affinity for cognate tumour antigens, overcoming the problem of low-affinity tumour-specific T cells imposed by thymic selection. 

Once bound to tumour cells, the anti-CD3 effector end of the ImmTAC drives recruitment of polyclonal T cells to the tumour site, leading to a potent redirected T cell response and tumour cell destruction. 

They specifically recognise human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted tumour-associated antigens, presented by cancer cells.

The first ImmTAC molecule to reach the clinic, tebentafusp (IMCgp100), has been demonstrated to have clinical efficacy in an immunologically cold solid tumour. 

Here, I will present some preclinical data of ImmTAC-NYE (a bifunctional ImmTAC comprising a soluble, high-affinity T-cell receptor (TCR) specific for NY-ESO-1157-165 fused to an anti-CD3 scFv). This reagent is shown to kill HLA-A2, antigen-positive tumour cell lines and freshly isolated HLA-A2- and LAGE-1-positive NSCLC cells. In vivo ImmTAC-NYE efficacy was tested in a tumour model in which human lymphocytes were stably co-engrafted into NSG mice harbouring tumour xenografts, and efficacy was observed in both tumour prevention and established tumour models using a GFP fluorescence readout. 

Overall, early promising clinical data suggests that ImmTACs are a promising therapeutic option for cancer.
