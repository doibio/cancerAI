	message: What is tebentafusp?
	text: Tebentafusp (tebentafusp-tebn, Kimmtrak®) is a novel, bispecific gp100 peptide-HLA-directed CD3 T-cell engager fusion protein, developed by Immunocore, for the treatment of metastatic uveal melanoma. It is administered via intravenous infusion daily or weekly. 

On January 25, 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Tebentafusp for the treatment of HLA-A*02:01-positive adult patients with unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma. It has also received a Positive Opinion from the EU Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for the same indication. 

According to pharmacodynamic data, tebentafusp targets a specific HLA-A*02:01/gp100 complex, activating both CD4+/CD8+ effector and memory T cells that induce tumor cell death. 

A phase I/II trial involving 84 patients with advanced melanoma reported that tebentafusp was well-tolerated and exhibited efficacy in both metastatic uveal melanoma and metastatic cutaneous melanoma patients. The trial documented a 1-year overall survival rate of 65% for both cohorts.
