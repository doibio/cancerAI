	message: What cancers can we target with ImmTAC?  Please list them all
	text: ImmTAC therapy can be used to target metastatic uveal melanoma, and appears to show a survival benefit in clinical trials. ImmTAC therapy is also being explored as a treatment for metastatic cutaneous melanoma.

Would you like to know more about any of these cancers?
