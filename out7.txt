	message: What other cancers would be amenable to Immune Mobilizing Monoclonal TCRs Against Cancer treatment?
	text: The Immune Mobilizing Monoclonal TCRs Against Cancer (ImmTAC) treatment has been explored for several types of cancers, with recent success demonstrated in uveal melanoma.

Uveal melanoma is the most common intraocular cancer in adults and tebentafusp is the first drug in the ImmTAC class of T cell-directed therapy. It has been shown to lead to improved overall survival and progression-free survival compared to other treatments when used on HLA-A*02:01-positive metastatic uveal melanoma patients. 

Given its success in this cancer type, it is worth exploring whether this treatment would be amenable to other cancers that exhibit similar characteristics to uveal melanoma.
