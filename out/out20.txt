	message: How many cancers can we target with ImmTAC?
	text: ImmTAC (Immune mobilizing monoclonal TCRs Against Cancer) is a bispecific fusion protein that can bind to specific target peptides presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) on the cell surface via an affinity-enhanced T cell receptor, and redirect T cell activation with an anti-CD3 effector moiety. 

Currently, tebentafusp is the first and only ImmTAC that has been approved for metastatic uveal melanoma. It has demonstrated an overall survival benefit in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma, with a modest overall response rate of 9%. 

Given tebentafusp's success in targeting uveal melanoma, it is likely more cancers will be targeted by ImmTAC in the future, following further research and development. Would you like to know more about tebentafusp and its clinical trials?
