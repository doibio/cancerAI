	message: What are the most promising new immunotherapies for cancer?
	text: Progress has been made in the treatment of tumors using immunotherapy, although it has historically been limited by the non-immunogenicity of tumors and the strong immunosuppressive environment. There are several promising new immunotherapies for cancer that are showing positive results in treating tumors. 

One example is the use of immunomodulatory drugs, which can effectively induce immunogenic cell death of metastatic cells and activate immune responses. Another example includes targeted nanoparticles, such as SIL@T, which can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and release drugs responsively in cancer cells. SIL@T accumulates at the metastatic site and can prolong the survival period of model animals. 

Other promising new immunotherapies include checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1 inhibitors, which have been widely applied in patients with lymphoma. Another example is STING (stimulator of interferon genes) protein-based in situ vaccines, which synergize CD4+ T, CD8+ T, and NK cells for tumor eradication. HPK1 inhibitors may also restore and elicit anti-tumor immune responses. 

Overall, there are several promising new directions in immunotherapy for cancer, which may provide effective therapeutic options for patients.
