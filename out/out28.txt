	message: What are some of the most recently approved FDA T-cell immunotherapy treatments for cancer?
	text: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved several T-cell immunotherapies for cancer treatment. Here are some of the most recent approvals:
- On February 28, 2022, the BCMA-targeted CAR T-cell therapy ciltacabtagene autoleucel (Carvykti) was approved to treat a subset of patients with multiple myeloma.
- On March 4, 2022, the PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab (Opdivo) was approved to be used in combination with chemotherapy before surgery for the treatment of a subset of patients with lung cancer.
- On March 18, 2022, a combination of nivolumab and the LAG-3 checkpoint inhibitor relatlimab (Opdualag) was approved for the treatment of a subset of patients with melanoma. 
- In 2017, the FDA approved tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah), the first CAR T-cell therapy, for the treatment of adults with certain types of large B-cell lymphoma.

Would you like to know more about any of these treatments?

I tried searching for more recently approved (2023) FDA T-cell immunotherapies for cancer but could not find any. 

Is there anything else I can help you with?

Scientists equip a patient’s T cells with a synthetic receptor known as a CAR, which stands for chimeric antigen receptor.\n\nA key advantage of CARs is their ability to bind to cancer cells even if their antigens aren’t presented on the surface via MHC, which can render more cancer cells vulnerable to their attacks. However, CAR T cells can only recognize antigens that themselves are naturally expressed on the cell surface, so the range of potential antigen targets is smaller than with TCRs.
