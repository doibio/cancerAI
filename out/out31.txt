	message: cancer treatment using modified immune cells
	text: Genetically modified immune cell cancer treatment is a transformative and promising new way to treat cancer. One example of this is CAR-T cell-based immunotherapy, which has been used to treat lymphoma, leukemia, myeloma, and other hematological malignancies. 

Researchers have also been able to engineer T-cells to recognise and combat B-cell cancers, specifically. They are expecting to receive approval for the first engineered T-cell therapies for cancer soon. 

However, while this treatment method holds much promise, there are still concerns about safety and the development of resistance, as well as off-target toxicity. Therefore, it is still important to approach this kind of treatment with caution. Would you like to know more about the safety concerns regarding this treatment?

Within the past few years, clinical trials using T cells engineered to recognize B cell cancers have shown high rates of response (70%â€“90%) and durability of response that are unprecedented in acute (Brentjens et al., 2013; Maude et al., 2014; Turtle et al., 2016) and chronic leukemia (Kalos et al., 2011). In 2017, we expect to see the first approved engineered T cell therapies coming to market.
