	message: What are the most promising new immunotherapies for cancer?
	text: Several new classes of cancer immunotherapies are showing promise in treating different types of cancer. 

One example is immunotherapies that use oncolytic viruses. Oncolytic viruses are viruses that target cancer cells by evading normal cells. These viruses include herpes, measles, adenovirus, coxsackie virus, reovirus, poliovirus, poxviruses, and Newcastle disease viruses. These oncolytic viruses are currently in clinical and preclinical development for cancer therapy. Another type of immunotherapy is the use of vaccines, which aim to stimulate the immune system to kill tumors and establish immune surveillance. 

Immunotherapy, in general, is an emerging strategy that aims to broaden effective T cell repertoire, priming effector T cells, promoting immune-mediated cell death, and modulating metabolic programming for sustained T cell function. The current standard treatments for cancer are radiation, chemo, or a combination of the two, and surgery; immunotherapy can be used in conjunction with these treatments. 

Would you like to know more about any of these cancer immunotherapies?

So to combat these drawbacks in the therapeutic strategies there is a need in the advancement of cancer therapy.
