	message: Who developed Tebentafusp?  Are they a good investment?
	text: Tebentafusp was developed by Immunocore Ltd, a pharmaceutical company specialising in immunotherapies and based in the UK. 

Immunocore's most well-known product is tebentafusp, a novel bispecific gp100 peptide-HLA-A*02:01 directed T cell receptor (TCR) CD3 T cell engager for the treatment of metastatic uveal melanoma. Uveal melanoma is a highly fatal disease with no currently approved treatment options, making tebentafusp a promising therapy. 

Several financial reports suggest that Immunocore's investment potential is favourable. A report detailing tebentafusp's cost-effectiveness against alternative therapies found that its cost-effectiveness could be improved through value-based pricing, though the report did not go into detail about specific financial figures.

The TCR arm of tebentafusp binds to HLA-A*02:01-positive uveal \nmelanoma cells and activates polyclonal T cells, through CD3, to release \ninflammatory cytokines and cytolytic proteins, resulting in the direct lysis of \ntumour cells. In January 2022, tebentafusp received its first approval in the \nUSA for the treatment of HLA-A*02:01-positive adults with unresectable or \nmetastatic uveal melanoma, and in February 2022 received a Positive Opinion from \nthe EU Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for the treatment of uveal \nmelanoma.', 'title': '35364798'}, {'id': 'doc_36:1', 'snippet': ' In contrast to cutaneous melanoma, kinase \ninhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors are usually ineffective in patients \nwith metastatic uveal melanoma.
