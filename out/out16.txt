	message: What are the three most promising treatments for cancer?
	text: I could not find precisely three promising treatments for cancer, but I did find various treatments that are showing promise. 

One way to treat cancer is through immunotherapies. Checkpoint inhibitors such as PD-1/PD-L1 antibody therapeutics are being developed to treat multiple cancers and are showing promise. Another way to use immunotherapy is through the use of cell therapy using T-cells or natural killer (NK) cells to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy drugs, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and radiotherapy are also commonly used in combination with other treatments to treat cancer. 

Additionally, trends in biotechnology have shown potential in using SPP, SPT, and their combination as a potential treatment for breast cancer due to their growth inhibitory effects. 

Would you like to know more about any of these treatments?
