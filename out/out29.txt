	message: What are some of the most recently approved FDA T-cell immunotherapy treatments for eye cancer?
	text: Uveal melanoma is an aggressive cancer of the eye with historically poor outcomes, as it would usually result in death within a year of metastasis.

Recently, the FDA approved Kimmtrak (tebentafusp), a novel type of immunotherapy for the treatment of advanced uveal melanoma. Kimmtrak is a bispecific T-cell engager, linking cancer-fighting T cells to their targets on tumors. It is administered by IV infusion once weekly and it has improved overall survival in clinical trials. 

According to Kyleigh LiPira, CEO of the Melanoma Research Foundation, Kimmtrak represents "not only a new therapy but a new hope for the individuals and the families of those diagnosed with the deadliest form of eye cancer."
