	text: ## Business Analysis of Immuncore with relation to Tebentafusp

Immuncore is a biotechnology company that researches and develops novel T-cell receptor-based drugs to treat diseases with a high unmet need, including cancer and viral diseases. 

Tebentafusp is a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) therapy that was the first drug to be approved by the FDA to treat metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM). 

## TAM and Other Indicators

TAM stands for total addressable market and represents the entire revenue opportunity that exists within a market for a product or service.

For a company already manufacturing and selling shampoo, a higher-end product line might be worth investigating, particularly if it produced healthier, shinier hair. 

## Conclusion
Given Immuncore's focus on developing novel T-cell receptor-based therapies to treat diseases with a high unmet need, their current market and future potential in the biotechnology sector looks promising. 

Would you like me to continue this business analysis with relation to any other indicators?

Tebentafusp-tebn is comprised of a soluble HLA-A*02:01-restricted T-cell receptor that is specific for the gp100 peptide and is fused to an anti-CD3 single-chain variable fragment (Nathan et al., 2021). Tebentafusp-tebn has a 1-million-fold greater affinity for gp100 presented by HLA-A*02:01 than natural T-cell receptors. Once bound to HLA-A*02:01-positive uveal melanoma cells, tebentafusp-tebn recruits and activates polyclonal T cells (via CD3) to release inflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic proteins, resulting in direct lysis of uveal melanoma tumor cells (Boudousquie et al., 2017; Middleton et al., 2020).', 'title': 'Tebentafusp-tebn: A Novel Bispecific T-Cell Engager for Metastatic Uveal Melanoma - PMC', 'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9514125/'}, {'id': 'web-search_11:29', 'snippet': ' Tebentafusp, a TCR/anti-CD3 bispecific fusion protein targeting gp100, potently activated antitumor immune responses in patients with metastatic melanoma.
