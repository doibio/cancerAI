	message: What are some of the most recently approved FDA treatments for cancer?
	text: Here are some of the recently approved FDA treatments for cancer:
- On December 27, 2019, the FDA approved a new indication for olaparib (Lynparza; AstraZeneca) for the maintenance treatment of adults with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma associated with a deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutation.
- Ayvakit (avapritinib) by Blueprint Medicines Corporation was the first targeted therapy approved for metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumour with PDGFRA mutations.
- Gavreto (pralsetinib) was approved for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic rearranged during transfection (RET) fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
- Libtayo (cemiplimab-rwlc) was approved in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 aberrations.
- Tecentriq (atezolizumab) in combination with Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel) was the first immunotherapy treatment approved for advanced triple-negative breast cancer.

Olaparib was previously approved for ovarian cancer and for breast cancer associated with BRAF mutation.\n\nAt the same time, the FDA approved the BRACAna\xadlysis CDx test (Myriad Genetic Laboratories) as a companion diagnostic for the selection of patients with pancreatic cancer for treatment with olaparib based on the identification of deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.', 'title': 'Recent Cancer Drugs Approved by the FDA', 'url': 'https://jhoponline.com/issue-archive/2020-issues/february-2020-vol-10-no-1/18024-recent-cancer-drugs-approved-by-the-fda-2020'}, {'id': 'web-search_7:3', 'snippet': '\n\nAyvakit First Targeted Therapy Approved for Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors with PDGFRA Mutations\n\nOn January 9, 2020, the FDA accelerated the approval of avapritinib (Ayvakit; Blueprint Medicines Corporation), a kinase inhibitor, for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) harboring a platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) exon 18 mutation. This approval includes GIST that harbors a PDGFRA D842V mutation, which is the most common exon 18 mutation. The FDA granted breakthrough therapy and orphan drug designations to avapritinib.\n\n“GIST harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation do not respond to standard therapies for GIST.

The FDA approved this drug in April for adults with advanced bladder cancer with a mutation in the FGFR3 or FGFR2 gene, and that has gotten worse after treatment with chemotherapy. The FDA also approved a test to look for these gene mutations.\n\nIn March, the FDA approved the first immunotherapy treatment for breast cancer.
