	message: What other cancers would be amenable to ImmunTAC treatment?
	text: Tebentafusp is the first drug in its class of immune mobilising monoclonal T-cell receptors against cancer (ImmTAC). Currently, it has only been tested in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma. 

ImmunTAC molecules are a novel class of T cell-redirecting bispecific biologics that exploit TCR-based targeting of tumour cells. Several other therapeutic modalities are being investigated in early phase clinical trials across various solid tumour indications.

It is worth noting that tebentafusp is specifically designed for patients with the human leukocyte antigen-A*02:01 complex.
