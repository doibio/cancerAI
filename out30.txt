	message: first TCR therapeutic approved for cancer
	text: The first TCR therapeutic approved for cancer was Immunocore's KIMMTRAK (tebentafusp; formerly IMCgp100). It was approved by the FDA on January 26, 2022, for use against uveal melanoma, a rare type of melanoma occurring in the eye. Uveal melanoma affects the eye and is considered a solid tumour. 

Immunocore's approval also marks several other firsts: 

- It is the first BiTE drug to be approved to treat a solid tumour.
- It is the first approved therapy for uveal melanoma.
- It is the first cancer cell and gene therapy approved in the US for any type of solid tumour cancer.

The approval came after the pivotal IMCgp100-202 trial demonstrated a one-year overall survival rate of 73% in patients with uveal melanoma treated with Immunocore's drug, compared to 58% in a group receiving standard-of-care treatment.
