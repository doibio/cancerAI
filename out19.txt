	message: Summarize these documents
	text: I found multiple documents related to tebentafusp and metastatic UM. 

For the first set of documents, tebentafusp is a drug commonly used to treat metastatic UM. However, it has a low response rate and may be accompanied by high treatment costs and significant immune-related toxicities. Hence, identifying biomarkers and clinical profiles predictive of treatment response is essential. 

In another set of documents, the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health reviewed tebentafusp (Kimmtrak). The report includes recommendations for treating physicians, summarising management procedures for adverse events and patient selection criteria. Patients in good clinical condition with low tumour burden are recommended to receive tebentafusp treatment early after diagnosis. 

Would you like me to summarise something else?
