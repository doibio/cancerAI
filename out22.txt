	message: What cancers can we target with ImmTAC?  Please list them all
	text: ImmTAC (Immune mobilising monoclonal T-cell receptors Against Cancer) is a class of bispecific biological drug being investigated for the treatment of cancer and viral infections. 

They work by targeting cancerous or virally infected cells through binding human leukocyte antigen (HLA) presented peptide antigens and redirecting the host's cytotoxic T cells to recognise and kill them. 

Currently, they are being investigated to target a range of cancer indications, including: 
- Hematologic tumours
- Solid tumours, such as metastatic site: liver non-small cell lung cancer adenocarcinoma
