	message: What other cancers would be amenable to ImmTAC treatment?
	text: Immunotherapy can be used to treat several types of cancers. Advanced solid tumors and specific tumor characteristics may make patients eligible for treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, regardless of the type of cancer. Patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma may be treated with ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab. 

Patients with advanced multiple myeloma may be treated with CAR T cell therapy. Certain B-cell lymphomas and leukemias may also be treated with CAR T-cell therapy or the cytokine therapy interferon alpha. 

Advanced cases of skin cancer and stomach cancer may also be treated with immunotherapy. Patients with alveolar soft part sarcoma may be eligible for treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab.
