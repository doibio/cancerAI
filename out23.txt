	message: Why does Tebentafusp sometimes not work?
	text: Several factors can impact the efficacy of tebentafusp, a drug recently approved by the FDA to treat metastatic uveal melanoma (UM). 

Firstly, tebentafusp exhibits HLA-A*02:01 allele specificity. Accordingly, only patients with this allele will respond to tebentafusp treatment. Given that the allele is restricted, tebentafusp will only work in individuals expressing this specific HLA haplotype. 

Secondly, like many other immunotherapeutic drugs, tebentafusp requires high-intensity monitoring due to potential severe side effects. This, coupled with its weekly dosing schedule, can present challenges for patients and healthcare providers, particularly in settings where oncology services are not easily accessible.

Lastly, the development of a week 1 rash has been associated with strong overall survival benefits due to the drug's ability to target gp100 on skin melanocytes. However, the presence of a rash is not a predictor of efficacy, and some patients without rash may still benefit from tebentafusp.

While tebentafusp shows promise as a treatment for metastatic uveal melanoma, challenges remain in ensuring its use in the most effective populations and under the appropriate monitoring conditions. Further research is necessary to optimize its application.
