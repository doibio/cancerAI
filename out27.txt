	message: What are some of the most recently approved FDA immunotherapy treatments for cancer?
	text: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved several immunotherapies for the treatment of different cancers. Here are some of the recently approved immunotherapy treatments for cancer:
- Nivolumab plus ipilimumab for the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with 1% or higher PD-L1 expression.
- Nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 2 cycles of platinum-doublet chemotherapy for first-line treatment of NSCLC.
- Atezolizumab monotherapy for the first-line treatment of NSCLC with 50% or higher PD-L1 expression.
- Durvalumab plus etoposide and carboplatin or cisplatin for the treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC).
- Combination of Tecentriq (atezolizumab) and Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel) for people with advanced triple negative breast cancer.
- Balversa (erdafitinib) is the first targeted therapy approved for bladder cancer in adults with advanced bladder cancer with a mutation in the FGFR3 or FGFR2 gene.
