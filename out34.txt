	message: Please evaluate tebentafusp for efficacy
	text: I found various studies that evaluate the efficacy of Tebentafusp.

One study that examined the safety and initial efficacy of tebentafusp in combination with durvalumab and/or tremelimumab in patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma (mCM), reports a 14% response rate and a 41% tumor shrinkage rate. whereas the 1-year overall survival (OS) rate was 76%. Another analysis found that the 1-year OS for the triplet combination was 79%, which was similar to tebentafusp plus durvalumab (74%). 

Another study focusing on metastatic uveal melanoma, reports that tebentafusp has demonstrated an overall survival benefit (HR 0.51) and an overall response rate of 9%. 

In another study, tebentafusp showed a conspicuously longer overall survival than the control group, yielding an additional 0.47 Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) compared to the control group. 

Overall, the results suggest that tebentafusp could change the standard of care for treating metastatic and potentially localized uveal melanoma.
