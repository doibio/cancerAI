PURPOSE OF REVIEW: T-cell-engaging antibodies or T-cell engagers (TCEs) can 
connect a patient's cytotoxic T cells with cancer cells, leading to potent 
redirected lysis. Until very recently, only one TCE was approved, the 
CD19/CD3-bispecific blinatumomab. Many new TCEs in late-stage clinical 
development target various hematopoietic lineage markers like CD20, BCMA, or 
CD123. Although very compelling single-agent activity of TCEs was observed with 
various blood-borne cancers, therapy of solid tumor indications has thus far 
been less successful.
RECENT FINDINGS: The approval in 2022 of the gp100 peptide-major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC)/CD3 bispecific TCE tebentafusp in uveal 
melanoma confirms that TCEs can also efficiently work against solid tumors. TCEs 
targeting peptide-MHC complexes will expand the target space for solid tumor 
therapy to intracellular targets. Likewise, early clinical trial data from TCEs 
targeting DLL3 in small cell lunger cancer showed promising antitumor activity. 
Various technologies for conditional activation of TCEs in the tumor 
microenvironment (TME) may expand the scope of conventional surface targets that 
suffer from a narrow therapeutic window. Finally, pharmacological enhancements 
for TCE therapies by engagement of certain costimulatory receptors and 
cytokines, or blockade of checkpoints, are showing promise.
SUMMARY: Targeting peptide-MHC complexes, conditional TCE technologies, and 
concepts enhancing TCE-activated T cells are paving the way towards overcoming 
challenges associated with solid tumor therapy.
