Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults. 
Compared to cutaneous melanoma (CM), which mainly harbors BRAF or NRAS 
mutations, UM predominantly harbors GNAQ or GNA11 mutations. Although primary UM 
can be controlled locally, approximately 50% of patients still develop 
metastases. To date, there have been no standard therapeutic strategies for the 
prevention or treatment of metastases. Unfortunately, chemotherapy and targeted 
therapies only induce minimal responses in patients with metastatic UM, with a 
median survival time of only 4-5 months after metastasis detection. 
Immunotherapy agents, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, have achieved 
pioneering outcomes in CM but have shown limited effects in UM. Researchers have 
explored several feasible checkpoints to identify options for future therapies. 
Cancer vaccines have shown little in the way of therapeutic benefit in patients 
with UM, and there are few ongoing trials providing favorable evidence, but 
adoptive cell transfer-related therapies seem promising and deserve further 
investigation. More recently, the immune-mobilizing monoclonal T-cell receptor 
against the cancer molecule tebentafusp showed impressive antitumor effects. 
Meanwhile, oncolytic viruses and small molecule inhibitors have also gained 
ground. This review highlights recent progress in burgeoning treatments and 
provides innovative insights on feasible strategies for the treatment of UM.
