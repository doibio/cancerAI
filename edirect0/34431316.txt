Metastatic uveal melanoma (MUM) is the most common form of noncutaneous 
melanoma. It isÂ different from its cutaneous counterpart and is characterized by 
a very poor prognosis. Despite groundbreaking improvements in the treatment of 
cutaneous melanoma, there have been few advances in the treatment of MUM, and 
standard treatments for MUM have not been defined. We performed a systematic 
review focusing our attention on all interventional studies, ongoing or already 
published, concerning the treatment of MUM. We present results from studies of 
chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy and liver-directed therapies. 
Although the results in this setting have been disappointing until now, trials 
investigating novel immunotherapeutic strategies alone and in combination with 
targeted agents and liver-directed therapies are ongoing.
