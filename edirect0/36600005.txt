Melanomas arising in the uveal tract of the eye are a rare form of the disease 
with a biology and clinical phenotype distinct from their more common cutaneous 
counterparts. Treatment of primary uveal melanoma with radiotherapy, enucleation 
or other modalities achieves local control in more than 90% of patients, 
although 40% or more ultimately develop distant metastases, most commonly in the 
liver. Until January 2022, no systemic therapy had received regulatory approval 
for patients with metastatic uveal melanoma, and these patients have 
historically had a dismal prognosis owing to the limited efficacy of the 
available treatments. A series of seminal studies over the past two decades have 
identified highly prevalent early, tumour-initiating oncogenic genomic 
aberrations, later recurring prognostic alterations and immunological features 
that characterize uveal melanoma. These advances have driven the development of 
a number of novel emerging treatments, including tebentafusp, the first systemic 
therapy to achieve regulatory approval for this disease. In this Review, our 
multidisciplinary and international group of authors summarize the biology of 
uveal melanoma, management of primary disease and surveillance strategies to 
detect recurrent disease, and then focus on the current standard and emerging 
regional and systemic treatment approaches for metastatic uveal melanoma.
