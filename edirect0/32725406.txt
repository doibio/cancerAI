PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Uveal melanoma is a distinct subtype of melanoma 
characterized by a unique biology and divergent response to immune therapies. In 
this review, we will discuss our current understanding of the pathophysiology of 
uveal melanoma, systemic treatment options for advanced disease, and potential 
future therapeutic directions.
RECENT FINDINGS: Although treatment with single-agent checkpoint blockade has 
been generally disappointing, the results of combined checkpoint blockade are 
modestly more promising. Several alternative systemic therapeutic approaches 
have been or are currently being investigated, including two agents that have 
been taken into registration-intent clinical trials: tebentafusp, a T cell 
redirecting agent, and IDE196, an oral protein kinase C inhibitor. Treatment of 
advanced uveal melanoma remains challenging, however, encouraging results from 
novel agents offer hope for improvement in the near future.
