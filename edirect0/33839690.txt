TCR Bispecific Boosts Survival in Uveal Melanoma.

[No authors listed]

A bispecific fusion protein designed to redirect T cells toward a 
melanoma-associated antigen helped prolong survival among patients with an 
aggressive form of eye cancer. If approved, tebentafusp could become the 
standard of care for metastatic uveal melanoma-but only for those patients with 
a particular HLA allele.
