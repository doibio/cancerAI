Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common ocular malignancy in adults, associated 
with the poorest prognosis, with metastatic disease occurring in up to 50% of 
patients. In contrast to metastatic cutaneous melanoma, the use of immune 
checkpoint inhibitors is associated with poor outcomes in metastatic uveal 
melanoma (mUM). Tebentafusp, a bispecific molecule, has recently become the 
first treatment in decades to improve overall survival for mUM. This review 
summarises the existing and emerging immuno-oncology approaches for the 
treatment of mUM, and biomarkers of response and resistance to the same. 
Finally, we propose future research directions that could maximise treatment 
benefit to a wider pool of patients with UM.
