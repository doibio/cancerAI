INTRODUCTION: Tebentafusp is a novel bispecific immune mobilizing T cell 
receptor (TCR)-based agent developed for the treatment of metastatic uveal 
melanoma, a highly fatal disease with no currently approved treatment options. 
Recent evidence suggests this drug may become the standard of care for 
first-line treatment of metastatic uveal melanoma.
AREAS COVERED: This review focuses on the development and investigation of 
tebentafusp for metastatic uveal melanoma. First, we discuss preclinical studies 
followed by clinical evaluation, culminating in a phase III trial showing 
improved overall survival with tebentafusp compared to standard of care. 
Finally, we expand upon key toxicities of tebentafusp and highlight biomarkers 
that may correlate with drug efficacy.
EXPERT OPINION: Tebentafusp provides a promising advancement to date for the 
management of metastatic uveal melanoma. Future studies should aim at 
identifying biomarkers that can predict treatment response or toxicity, 
combination therapy, application of tebentafusp in the adjuvant setting to 
reduce the risk of recurrence, and development of bispecifics with activity in 
other HLA subtypes. With its novel mechanism of action, degree of efficacy and 
safety profile, tebentafusp is expected to change the standard of care for 
treating metastatic and, potentially localized, uveal melanoma.
