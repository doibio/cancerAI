BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in the treatment of primary uveal melanoma 
(UM), patients with metastatic disease continue to exhibit poor survival.
METHODS: A retrospective review of metastatic UM patients at Yale (initial 
cohort) and Memorial Sloan Kettering (validation cohort) was conducted. Cox 
proportional hazards regression was used to determine baseline factors that are 
associated with overall survival, including sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) Performance Status Scale, laboratory measurements, metastasis 
location, and use of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 therapies. Differences in overall 
survival were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 89 patients with metastatic UM were identified; 71 and 18, 
in the initial and validation cohorts, respectively. In the initial cohort, 
median follow-up was 19.8 months (range, 2-127 months) and median overall 
survival was 21.8 months (95% CI, 16.6-31.3). Female sex, anti-CTLA-4, and 
anti-PD-1 therapy were associated with better survival outcomes with adjusted 
death hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.40 (95% CI, 0.20-0.78), 0.44 (0.20-0.97), and 
0.42 (0.22-0.84), respectively, whereas development of hepatic metastases and 
ECOG score ≥1 (per 1 U/L) were associated with worse survival outcomes with HRs 
of 2.86 (1.28-7.13) and 2.84 (1.29-6.09), respectively. In both the initial and 
validation cohorts, use of immune checkpoint inhibitors was associated with 
improved overall survival after adjusting for sex and ECOG score, with death HRs 
of 0.22 (0.08-0.56) and 0.04 (0.002-0.26), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Development of extrahepatic-only metastases, ECOG of 0, immune 
checkpoint therapy, and female sex were each associated with more than 2-fold 
reductions in risk of death.
PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Metastatic uveal melanoma patients face limited 
treatment options and poor survival rates. Results from this retrospective 
analysis indicate that immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-CTLA-4 and 
anti-PD-1 therapies, were associated with improved survival outcomes. Factors 
such as extrahepatic-only metastases, better baseline performance status, and 
female sex contributed to a more than 2-fold reduction in death risk. These 
findings highlight the potential of immunotherapy in treating metastatic uveal 
melanoma.
