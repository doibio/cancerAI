BACKGROUND: Tebentafusp has recently been approved for the treatment of 
metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM) after proving to have survival benefits in a 
first-line setting.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective, multicenter study analyzed the 
outcomes and safety of tebentafusp therapy in 78 patients with mUM.
RESULTS: Patients treated with tebentafusp had a median PFS of 3 months (95% CI 
2.7 to 3.3) and a median OS of 22 months (95% CI 10.6 to 33.4). In contrast to a 
published Phase 3 study, our cohort had a higher rate of patients with elevated 
LDH (65.4% vs. 35.7%) and included patients with prior systemic and local 
ablative therapies. In patients treated with tebentafusp following ICI, there 
was a trend for a longer median OS (28 months, 95% CI 26.9 to 29.1) compared to 
the inverse treatment sequence (24 months, 95% CI 13.0 to 35.0, p = 0.257). The 
most common treatment-related adverse events were cytokine release syndrome in 
71.2% and skin toxicity in 53.8% of patients. Tumor lysis syndrome occurred in 
one patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Data from this real-life cohort showed a median PFS/OS similar to 
published Phase 3 trial data. Treatment with ICI followed by tebentafusp may 
result in longer PFS/OS compared to the inverse treatment sequence.
