BACKGROUND: Distinct systemic treatments exist for metastatic uveal melanoma. 
Tebentafusp and combined immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with ipilimumab plus 
anti-PD-1 antibodies are the most commonly used treatment options but their 
comparative efficacy is unclear. The aim of this study is to compare currently 
available systemic treatments regarding overall survival (OS) and 
progression-free survival (PFS) with a focus on the comparison of tebentafusp 
versus combined ICB.
METHODS: The protocol for this study was defined a priori and registered online 
in the PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews 
(CRD42022308356, date of registration: 7.2.2022). We performed a systematic 
literature search in Medline, Embase, and Central to identify eligible studies 
reporting Kaplan-Meier curves or individual-level survival data showing OS and 
PFS for metastatic uveal melanoma patients treated with systemic treatments. 
Kaplan-Meier curves were digitized using the "WebPlotDigitizer" program. 
Individual-level survival data were subsequently remodelled and pooled for 
distinct treatment groups. To compare the OS of tebentafusp versus combined ICB, 
we used matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC), two-stage MAIC (2SMAIC), 
and simulated treatment comparison (STC) together with digitized 
individual-level survival data as population-adjusted models.
RESULTS: Overall, 55 independent studies were included of which 2,682 patients 
were evaluable for OS and 2,258 for PFS. Tebentafusp showed the highest median 
OS (mOS) of 22.4 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 19.9-29.6) compared to 
combined ICB (mOS: 15.7 months (95% CI: 14.4-17.9)), anti-PD-(L)1 antibody (mOS: 
10.9 months (95% CI: 9.8-13.4)), chemotherapy (mOS: 9.95 months (95% CI: 
8.9-11.2)), targeted therapies (mOS: 8.86 months (95% CI: 7.5-10.8)), and 
anti-CTLA-4 antibody (mOS: 7.8 months (95% CI: 6.8-9.3). The median PFS (mPFS) 
was similar among the treatment groups ranging from 2.7 months to 3.4 months. 
For the comparison of tebentafusp versus combined ICB, the hazard ratio (HR) was 
0.641 (95% CI: 0.449-0.915) in the unadjusted model, whereas the 
population-adjusted models showed a HR of 0.386 (95% CI: 0.236-0.631) using 
MAIC, 0.378 (95% CI: 0.234-0.612) applying 2SMAIC and 0.284 (95% CI: 
0.184-0.440) using STC.
CONCLUSIONS: Tebentafusp achieved the best results compared to combined ICB and 
other systemic treatments, although these results have to be interpreted with 
caution due to the approximative methodical approach and high heterogeneity of 
included studies.
