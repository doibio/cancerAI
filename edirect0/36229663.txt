In patients with previously treated metastatic uveal melanoma, the historical 
1 year overall survival rate is 37% with a median overall survival of 
7.8 months. We conducted a multicenter, single-arm, open-label phase 2 study of 
tebentafusp, a soluble T cell receptor bispecific (gp100×CD3), in 127 patients 
with treatment-refractory metastatic uveal melanoma (NCT02570308). The primary 
endpoint was the estimation of objective response rate based on RECIST (Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours) v1.1. Secondary objectives included 
safety, overall survival, progression-free survival and disease control rate. 
All patients had at least one treatment-related adverse event, with rash (87%), 
pyrexia (80%) and pruritus (67%) being the most common. Toxicity was mostly mild 
to moderate in severity but was greatly reduced in incidence and intensity after 
the initial three doses. Despite a low overall response rate of 5% (95% CI: 
2-10%), the 1 year overall survival rate was 62% (95% CI: 53-70%) with a median 
overall survival of 16.8 months (95% CI: 12.9-21.3), suggesting benefit beyond 
traditional radiographic-based response criteria. In an exploratory analysis, 
early on-treatment reduction in circulating tumour DNA was strongly associated 
with overall survival, even in patients with radiographic progression. Our 
findings indicate that tebentafusp has promising clinical activity with an 
acceptable safety profile in patients with previously treated metastatic uveal 
melanoma, and data suggesting ctDNA as an early indicator of clinical benefit 
from tebentafusp need confirmation in a randomized trial.
