Nail apparatus melanoma (NAM) is a rare type of cutaneous melanoma that belongs 
to the acral melanoma subtype. NAM is managed principally in accordance with the 
general treatment for cutaneous melanoma, but there is scarce evidence in 
support of this in the literature. Acral melanoma is genetically different from 
non-acral cutaneous melanoma, while recently accumulated data suggest that NAM 
also has a different genetic background from acral melanoma. In this review, we 
focus on recent advances in the management of NAM. Localized NAM should be 
surgically removed; amputation of the digit and digit-preserving surgery have 
been reported. Sentinel lymph node biopsy can be considered for invasive NAM for 
the purpose of accurate staging. However, it is yet to be clarified whether 
patients with metastatic sentinel lymph nodes can be safely spared completion 
lymph node dissection. Similar to cutaneous melanoma, immune checkpoint 
inhibitors and BRAF/MEK inhibitors are used as the first-line treatment for 
metastatic NAM, but data on the efficacy of these therapies remain scarce. The 
therapeutic effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors could be lower for NAM than 
for cutaneous melanoma. This review highlights the urgent need to accumulate 
data to better define the optimal management of this rare melanoma.
