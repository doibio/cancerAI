BACKGROUND: Tebentafusp, a T-cell receptor-bispecific molecule that targets 
glycoprotein 100 and CD3, is approved for adult patients who are positive for 
HLA-A*02:01 and have unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma. The primary 
analysis in the present phase 3 trial supported a long-term survival benefit 
associated with the drug.
METHODS: We report the 3-year efficacy and safety results from our open-label, 
phase 3 trial in which HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with previously untreated 
metastatic uveal melanoma were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive 
tebentafusp (tebentafusp group) or the investigator's choice of therapy with 
pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, or dacarbazine (control group), with randomization 
stratified according to the lactate dehydrogenase level. The primary end point 
was overall survival.
RESULTS: At a minimum follow-up of 36 months, median overall survival was 21.6 
months in the tebentafusp group and 16.9 months in the control group (hazard 
ratio for death, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.87). The estimated 
percentage of patients surviving at 3 years was 27% in the tebentafusp group and 
18% in the control group. The most common treatment-related adverse events of 
any grade in the tebentafusp group were rash (83%), pyrexia (76%), pruritus 
(70%), and hypotension (38%). Most tebentafusp-related adverse events occurred 
early during treatment, and no new adverse events were observed with long-term 
administration. The percentage of patients who discontinued treatment because of 
adverse events continued to be low in both treatment groups (2% in the 
tebentafusp group and 5% in the control group). No treatment-related deaths 
occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: This 3-year analysis supported a continued long-term benefit of 
tebentafusp for overall survival among adult HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with 
previously untreated metastatic uveal melanoma. (Funded by Immunocore;
