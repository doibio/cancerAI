In this 14th installment of the annual Antibodies to Watch article series, we 
discuss key events in commercial monoclonal antibody therapeutics development 
that occurred in 2022 and forecast events that might occur in 2023. As of 
mid-November, 12 antibody therapeutics had been granted first approvals in 
either the United States or European Union (tebentafusp (Kimmtrak), faricimab 
(Vabysmo), sutimlimab (Enjaymo), relatlimab (Opdualag), tixagevimab/cilgavimab 
(Evusheld), mosunetuzumab (Lunsumio), teclistamab (TECVAYLI), spesolimab 
(SPEVIGO), tremelimumab (Imjudo; combo with durvalumab), nirsevimab (Beyfortus), 
mirvetuximab soravtansine (ELAHEREâ„¢), and teplizumab (TZIELD)), including 4 
bispecific antibodies and 1 ADC. Based on FDA action dates, several additional 
product candidates could be approved by the end of 2022. An additional seven 
were first approved in China or Japan in 2022, including two bispecific 
antibodies (cadonilimab and ozoralizumab). Globally, at least 24 investigational 
antibody therapeutics are undergoing review by regulatory agencies as of 
mid-November 2022. Our data show that, with antibodies for COVID-19 excluded, 
the late-stage commercial clinical pipeline grew by ~20% in the past year to 
include nearly 140 investigational antibody therapeutics that were designed 
using a wide variety of formats and engineering techniques. Of those in 
late-stage development, marketing application submissions for at least 23 may 
occur by the end of 2023, of which 5 are bispecific (odronextamab, erfonrilimab, 
linvoseltamab, zanidatamab, and talquetamab) and 2 are ADCs (datopotamab 
deruxtecan, and tusamitamab ravtansine).

Conflict of interest statement: HK and JV are employed by companies that develop 
antibody therapeutics. JMR is employed by The Antibody Society, a non-profit 
trade association funded by corporate sponsors that develop antibody 
therapeutics or provide services to companies that develop antibody 
therapeutics, and she is Editor-in-Chief of mAbs, a biomedical journal focused 
on topics relevant to antibody therapeutics development. Data in this 
publication were collected from publicly available sources.
