Uveal melanoma is the most common intraocular cancer in adults. Metastatic uveal 
melanoma has a poor prognosis. Tebentafusp-tebn is the first drug in the new 
immune mobilizing monoclonal T-cell receptors against cancer (ImmTAC) class of T 
cell-directed therapy. Tebentafusp-tebn has been shown in a randomized phase III 
clinical trial to lead to improved overall survival and progression-free 
survival when compared with single-agent pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, or 
dacarbazine in previously untreated human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA)-A*02:01-positive metastatic uveal melanoma patients. Tebentafusp-tebn is 
now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in HLA-A*02:01-positive 
uveal melanoma patients as first-line therapy in the metastatic setting.
