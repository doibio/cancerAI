Tebentafusp is a recombinant bispecific fusion protein that binds both the gp100 
peptide expressed in HLA-A*02:01 on melanoma cells and the CD3 T cell engager. 
It is used to treat metastatic or unresectable uveal melanoma. Tebentafusp is 
associated with frequent elevations in serum ALT, AST and bilirubin during 
therapy, usually in association with cytokine release syndrome that can lead to 
interruption or early discontinuation of therapy, but instances of clinically 
apparent liver injury with jaundice independent of cytokine release syndrome 
have not been reported.
