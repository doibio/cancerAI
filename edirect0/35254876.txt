PURPOSE: This phase I study aimed to define the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) 
of tebentafusp, a first-in-class T-cell receptor/anti-CD3 bispecific protein, 
using a three-week step-up dosing regimen, and to assess its safety, 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary clinical activity in 
patients with metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM).
METHODS: In this open-label, international, phase I/II study, HLA-A*02 or 
HLA-A*02:01+ patients with mUM received tebentafusp 20 μg once in week 1 and 30 
μg once in week 2. Dose escalation (starting at 54 μg) began at week 3 in a 
standard 3 + 3 design to define RP2D. Expansion-phase patients were treated at 
the RP2D (20-30-68 μg). Blood and tumor samples were collected for 
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics assessment, and treatment efficacy was 
evaluated for all patients with baseline efficacy data as of December 2017.
RESULTS: Between March 2016 and December 2017, 42 eligible patients who failed a 
median of two previous treatments were enrolled: 19 in the dose escalation 
cohort and 23 in an initial dose expansion cohort. Of the dose levels 
investigated, 68 μg was identified as the RP2D. Most frequent treatment-emergent 
adverse events regardless of attribution were pyrexia (91%), rash (83%), 
pruritus (83%), nausea (74%), fatigue (71%), and chills (69%). Toxicity 
attenuated following the first three doses. The overall response rate was 11.9% 
(95% CI, 4.0 to 25.6). With a median follow-up of 32.4 months, median overall 
survival was 25.5 months (range, 0.89-31.1 months) and 1-year overall survival 
rate was 67%. Treatment was associated with increased tumor T-cell infiltration 
and transient increases in serum inflammatory mediators.
CONCLUSION: Using a step-up dosing regimen of tebentafusp allowed a 36% increase 
in the RP2D compared with weekly fixed dosing, with a manageable side-effect 
profile and a signal of efficacy in mUM.
