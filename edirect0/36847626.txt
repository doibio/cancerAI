On January 25, 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the 
use of tebentafusp, a bispecific glycoprotein 100 (gp100) peptide-human 
leukocyte antigen (HLA)-directed CD3 T-cell activator, for the treatment of 
HLA-A*02:01-positive adult patients with unresectable or metastatic uveal 
melanoma (mUM). Pharmacodynamic data indicate that tebentafusp targets a 
specific HLA-A*02:01/gp100 complex, activating both CD4+/CD8+ effector and 
memory T cells that induce tumor cell death. Tebentafusp is administered to 
patients via intravenous infusion daily or weekly, depending on the indication. 
Phase III trials have documented a 1-year overall survival of 73%, overall 
response rate of 9%, progression-free survival of 31% and disease control rate 
of 46%. Common adverse events reported are cytokine release syndrome, rash, 
pyrexia, pruritus, fatigue, nausea, chills, abdominal pain, edema, hypotension, 
dry skin, headache and vomiting. Compared to other types of melanomas, mUM 
presents with a distinct profile of genetic mutations, which phenotypically 
results in limited survival efficacy when using traditional melanoma treatments. 
The low current treatment efficacy for mUM, alongside a poor long-term prognosis 
and high mortality rates, gives precedence for the approval of tebentafusp to be 
groundbreaking in its clinical impact. This review will discuss the 
pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile, and the clinical trials used to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of tebentafusp.
