Tebentafusp, a T cell-redirecting, bispecific-antibody-targeting, 
HLA∗02:01-restricted gp100 peptide and CD3, induces T cells to kill glycoprotein 
100 (gp100)-expressing tumor cells. Tebentafusp is the first T cell engager to 
show a statistically significant overall survival improvement for the treatment 
of patients with solid tumors, and this has been reported in the New England 
Journal of Medicine.
