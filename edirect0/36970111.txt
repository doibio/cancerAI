Tebentafusp is a first-in-class immunotherapy agent that comprises an engineered 
T-cell receptor targeting a gp100 epitope presented by human leukocyte 
antigen-A*02:01 cells, fused to an anti-CD3 single-chain variable fragment. 
Tebentafusp is both the first bispecific T-cell engager to show efficacy in the 
treatment of advanced solid cancer and the first anti-cancer treatment to 
demonstrate an overall survival benefit in patients with uveal melanoma (UM). 
This review article will focus on the clinical development of tebentafusp, the 
mechanism of action and resultant evolution of the management of advanced UM.
