Tebentafusp (tebentafusp-tebn; Kimmtrak®) is a first-in-class, bispecific gp100 
peptide-HLA-A*02:01 directed T cell receptor (TCR) CD3 T cell engager being 
developed by Immunocore for the treatment of uveal melanoma and malignant 
melanoma. The TCR arm of tebentafusp binds to HLA-A*02:01-positive uveal 
melanoma cells and activates polyclonal T cells, through CD3, to release 
inflammatory cytokines and cytolytic proteins, resulting in the direct lysis of 
tumour cells. In January 2022, tebentafusp received its first approval in the 
USA for the treatment of HLA-A*02:01-positive adults with unresectable or 
metastatic uveal melanoma, and in February 2022 received a Positive Opinion from 
the EU Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for the treatment of uveal 
melanoma. Tebentafusp is under regulatory review for the treatment of metastatic 
uveal melanoma in the UK, Australia and Canada. Clinical studies of tebentafusp 
are underway for uveal melanoma and cutaneous melanoma in several countries 
worldwide. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of 
tebentafusp leading to this first approval for unresectable or metastatic uveal 
melanoma.
