Metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM) is one of the most rapidly progressing tumors, 
with a bad prognosis and no standard-of-care treatment. Immune checkpoint 
inhibitors have revolutionized cancer therapy and improved overall survival in 
patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma (mCM). However, this approach has 
been largely unimpressive, with no significant impact on the survival of mUM 
patients. Technical advances in immunotherapies have led to the development of 
novel T cell receptor (TCR)-based approaches to fight cancer. For the first time 
in over 50 years, compelling evidence demonstrates the power of TCR-based 
approaches for survival in mUM patients. Hence, this review summarizes novel 
TCR-based immunotherapeutic strategies currently in clinical studies for mUM 
treatment. We also discuss the potential combinational treatments to these 
strategies to maximize the clinical benefits.
