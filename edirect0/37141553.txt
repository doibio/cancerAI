Significant advancements have been made in the treatment of advanced melanoma 
with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, novel immunotherapies, and 
BRAF/MEK-targeted therapies with numerous frontline treatment options. However, 
there remains suboptimal evidence to guide treatment decisions in many patients. 
These include patients with newly diagnosed disease, immune checkpoint inhibitor 
(ICI)-resistant/ICI-refractory disease, CNS metastases, history of autoimmune 
disease, and/or immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Uveal melanoma (UM) is a 
rare melanoma associated with a poor prognosis in the metastatic setting. 
Systemic treatments, including checkpoint inhibitors, failed to demonstrate any 
survival benefit. Tebentafusp, a bispecific molecule, is the first treatment to 
improve overall survival (OS) in patients with HLA A*02:01-positive metastatic 
UM.
