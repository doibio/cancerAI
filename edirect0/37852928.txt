According to recent research, bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are a promising new 
immunotherapy method. Various BsAb forms are constantly being developed. In the 
year 2022 alone, four BsAbs (tebentafusp, faricimab, mosunetuzumab, and 
teclistamab) were approved for clinical applications. BsAbs including 
odronextamab, talquetamab, linvoseltamab, and elranatamab are being actively 
evaluated in different clinical studies. Preliminary results show promising 
response rates in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (RRFL), 
relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (RRDLBCL), and 
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), especially in heavily pretreated 
patients, including those who have progressed after proteasome inhibitors, 
immunomodulatory drugs, anti-CD38 antibodies, and CAR-T therapies. We summarized 
data published at the 28th European Hematology Association (EHA) annual meeting, 
which was held in Frankfurt between 8 June 2023 and 11 June 2023 on BsAbs 
monotherapy or combination therapy for RRFL, RRDLBCL, and RRMM.
