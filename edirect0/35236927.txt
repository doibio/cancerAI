Uveal melanoma is a rare subtype of melanoma that once metastatic portends a 
poor prognosis. Likely due to the distinct differences in biology, metastatic 
potential, and immunologic profile as compared to cutaneous melanoma, uveal 
melanoma's response to immune checkpoint inhibition has been disappointing. 
Bi-specific fusion protein therapies (T cell engagers) are a novel strategy to 
forcibly bridge the immune system with a target on a cancer cell. This approach 
has been explored in a number of cancer types and has recently demonstrated 
success in uveal melanoma. Tebentafusp, a first in class ImmTAC 
(Immune-mobilizing monoclonal TCRs against cancer), has now shown an overall 
survival benefit when compared to investigator's choice. This review aims to 
summarize the experience with this first in class bi-specific T cell engager as 
well as highlight bi-specifics as a novel treatment strategy in uveal melanoma.
