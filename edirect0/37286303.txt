BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have significantly improved outcomes in 
first line cutaneous melanoma. However, there is a high unmet need for patients 
who progress on these therapies and combination therapies are being explored to 
improve outcomes. Tebentafusp is a first-in-class gp100×CD3 ImmTAC bispecific 
that demonstrated overall survival (OS) benefit (HR 0.51) in metastatic uveal 
melanoma despite a modest overall response rate of 9%. This phase 1b trial 
evaluated the safety and initial efficacy of tebentafusp in combination with 
durvalumab (anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1)) and/or tremelimumab 
(anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4) in patients with metastatic 
cutaneous melanoma (mCM), the majority of whom progressed on prior checkpoint 
inhibitors.
METHODS: In this open-label, multicenter, phase 1b, dose-escalation trial, 
HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with mCM received weekly intravenous tebentafusp 
with increasing monthly doses of durvalumab and/or tremelimumab starting day 15 
of each cycle. The primary objective was to identify the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose for each combination. Efficacy analyses were 
performed in all tebentafusp with durvalumab±tremelimumab treated patients with 
a sensitivity analysis in those who progressed on prior anti-PD(L)1 therapy.
RESULTS: 85 patients were assigned to receive tebentafusp in combination with 
durvalumab (n=43), tremelimumab (n=13), or durvalumab and tremelimumab (n=29). 
Patients were heavily pretreated with a median of 3 prior lines of therapy, 
including 76 (89%) who received prior anti-PD(L)1. Maximum target doses of 
tebentafusp (68 mcg) alone or in combination with durvalumab (20 mg/kg) and 
tremelimumab (1 mg/kg) were tolerated; MTD was not formally identified for any 
arm. Adverse event profile was consistent with each individual therapy and there 
were no new safety signals nor treatment-related deaths. In the efficacy subset 
(n=72), the response rate was 14%, tumor shrinkage rate was 41% and 1-year OS 
rate was 76% (95% CI: 70% to 81%). The 1-year OS for triplet combination (79%; 
95% CI: 71% to 86%) was similar to tebentafusp plus durvalumab (74%; 95% CI: 67% 
to 80%).
CONCLUSION: At maximum target doses, the safety of tebentafusp with checkpoint 
inhibitors was consistent with safety of each individual therapy. Tebentafusp 
with durvalumab demonstrated promising efficacy in heavily pretreated patients 
with mCM, including those who progressed on prior anti-PD(L)1.
