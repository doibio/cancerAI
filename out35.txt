	message: Please do a business analysis of the company Immuncore with relation to Tebentafusp.
	text: Immunocore is a global commercial-stage biotechnology company, based in Oxfordshire, which researches and develops biological drugs using soluble T-cell receptor technology. It was founded in 2008 as a spinout of MediGene AG, which acquired Avidex in 2006. 

Tebentafusp, also known as Tebentafusp-tebn, is a bispecific antibody engaging T cells with gp100 on HLA-A*02:01. It is the first drug in the new ImmTAC class of T cell–directed therapy. Tebentafusp-tebn has been demonstrated to lead to significantly improved overall survival and progression-free survival in select metastatic uveal melanoma patients. 

Therefore, Immuncore appears to be a company that conducts business relating to Tebentafusp. Would you like to know more about any of the information presented above?

Tebentafusp-tebn is comprised of a soluble HLA-A*02:01-restricted T-cell receptor that is specific for the gp100 peptide and is fused to an anti-CD3 single-chain variable fragment (Nathan et al., 2021). Tebentafusp-tebn has a 1-million-fold greater affinity for gp100 presented by HLA-A*02:01 than natural T-cell receptors. Once bound to HLA-A*02:01-positive uveal melanoma cells, tebentafusp-tebn recruits and activates polyclonal T cells (via CD3) to release inflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic proteins, resulting in direct lysis of uveal melanoma tumor cells (Boudousquie et al., 2017; Middleton et al., 2020).', 'title': 'Tebentafusp-tebn: A Novel Bispecific T-Cell Engager for Metastatic Uveal Melanoma - PMC', 'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9514125/'}, {'id': 'web-search_3:3', 'snippet': ' Tebentafusp, a bispecific antibody engaging T cells with gp 100 on HLA-A*02:01, was recently approved by the FDA as the first drug of its class and the first treatment approved by the FDA to treat UM.
