	message: Please evaluate tebentafusp for efficacy and side effects
	text: Tebentafusp is a drug currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of uveal melanoma. It is used in combination with durvalumab. 

One of the main side effects of tebentafusp is cytokine-release syndrome, which causes symptoms such as rash, fever, and flu-like feelings. In one study, cytokine-release syndrome was observed in 71.2% of patients. In most cases, this side effect is not serious and can be treated well with medication. However, in one rare case, a patient experienced tumor lysis syndrome after receiving a single dose of tebentafusp. Tumor lysis syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by the rapid breakdown of cancer cells and the release of harmful substances into the blood. 

Other common adverse reactions of any grade observed in patients treated with tebentafusp include rash (83%), pyrexia (76%), pruritus (70%), and hypotension (38%). There have been no reported treatment-related deaths.

Based on the available data, tebentafusp has demonstrated promising efficacy and a consistent adverse event profile with other therapies. However, it is important to note that the drug is still under clinical trials and further research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and potential side effects.
